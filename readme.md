## V1.0 - redlight/greenlight functionality. 
If a player moves during redlight phase, they will get fired at until they are dead or the mark is removed.
- Determine firing range by using onenter trigger w/ customParam "inrange", "outrange"
- redlight starts by sending customParam message "redlight"
- redlight ends (greenlight starts) by sending customParam message "greenlight"
- to fine-tune, change values of VEL_NOTMOVING, MS_FIRERATE, GUNDAMAGE in the host.krnk file.
	- VEL_NOTMOVING: how fast can a player move before we start shooting it (pixels/ms)
	- MS_FIRERATE: how fast to shoot
	- GUNDAMAGE: how much damage per shot
	
### Tips:
1. player always spawns out of range of firing
2. customParam messages are caps sensitive ("redlight" works, "ReDlIgHt" does not work)
	
## V1.1 (if you want :D then I will work on this)  
- players will NOT be allowed to 🛑↪️ ROTATE or even 🛑⬇️ CROUCH
- Shows ❌ RED MARK underneath you if you are marked during redlight
	- will 🌘DARKEN the sky when u are about to be shot
- 🔫 Gun will take time shooting the NEAREST marked players (start shooting the nearest player, after nearest marked player dies, start shooting next nearest player)
	- ⏱️❎ green light phase will only start when all marked players are dead
- 🤖 robot head will PAUSE AND POINT LASER 😱 if it detects movement, & wait to DETECT MORE MOVEMENT 😣 before shooting
	- bullets will 🗡️PIERCE players and damage others behind them (requires raycasting (WIP) from KS, or my already made custom collision code 😏)
	- players can 😈 HIDE behind other players and continue moving (also requires raycasting (WIP) from KS, or my already made custom collision code 😏)
- 🎬 CUTSCENE to start round
